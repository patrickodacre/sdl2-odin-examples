## Beginners Learning to Code

Most people interested in learning how to code end up learning to program in the context of web development.

While web development can be fun, it is complex, and beginners are usually forced to learn a lot of secondary technology before they can start writing interesting programs.

In the earlier days of computing, many skilled programmers got their start by programming their own games. It is a fun, creative, challenging, and very effective way to learn how to code.
